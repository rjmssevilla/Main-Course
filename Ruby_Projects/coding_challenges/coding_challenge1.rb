You like building blocks. You especially like building blocks that are squares. And what you even like more, is to arrange them into a square of square building blocks!
However, sometimes, you can't arrange them into a square. Instead, you end up with an ordinary rectangle! Those blasted things! If you just had a way to know, whether you're currently working in vainâ€¦ Wait! That's it! You just have to check if your number of building blocks is a perfect square.
Task
Given an integral number, determine if it's a square number:
In mathematics, a square number or perfect square is an integer that is the square of an integer; in other words, it is the product of some integer with itself
Examples
-1 => false
0 => true
3 => false
4 => true
25 => true
26 => false

number = 25

def is_square(x)
   if x < 0
    return false
   elsif (x**0.5 % 1) == 0
    return true
   else
    return false
   end
end

puts is_square(number)
